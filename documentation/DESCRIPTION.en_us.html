Amiri Typewriter is a monospace Arabic and Latin typeface family. 
The design is inspired inspired by old Arabic typewriters, and features a very simplified Arabic design with most letters using one shape for both isolated and final forms, and one other shape for initial and medial forms (with few exceptions.)

Like most Arabic typewriters, Amiri Typewriter is not truly mono-width; 
the advance width for all glyphs is the same but really wide glyphs cheat by protruding outside the glyph box to avoid being too cramped. 
This is tolerated because almost all these wide glyphs are isolated or final forms, so they are always followed by white space.

It is drawn as a companion to the <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Amiri">Amiri</a> font family. 
Amiri itself is a classical Arabic typeface in Naskh style for typesetting books and other running text. 
It is a revival of the beautiful typeface pioneered in early 20th century by Bulaq Press in Cairo, also known as Amiria Press, after which the font is named.

The Amiri Typewriter project is led by Khaled Hosny, a type designer based in Cairo, Egypt.
